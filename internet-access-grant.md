<h1 class="color-pnm-red"> Pista ng Mapa 2020 Internet Access Grant</h1>

This year’s conference has adopted an online format, and we are offering aid to help lower some technical barriers to conference participation.

In the Philipplines, one of the biggest barriers to accessing online content is obtaining Internet accesss especially now that traditional venues (Internet shops, cafés, schools, offices) remain inaccessible due to Covid-19 restrictions.

To ensure Internet access to participants of PnM20, Internet Access Grants (IAG) will be given to approved applicants based in the Philippines

<h2 class="color-pnm-blue">Eligibility</h2>

* Resident of the Philippines
* Philippine prepaid SIM number (for phone, pocket wifi or “Home WiFi”)
* Has not been disqualified from a previous IAG tranche

<h2 class="color-pnm-blue">Application</h2>

* Participants must fill-in the application form, and answer questions to determine their profile
* To receive a final “bonus” tranche, grant recipients whose records show them attending all three conference sessions only need to complete a feedback form.
