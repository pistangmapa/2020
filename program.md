## Call for Presentations
We would like to invite people to submit presentations and sessions to help make our conference a success! The deadline for submissions is on March 31. Visit the link below to submit your proposed sessions.

### Session types
We provide the following submission types:

**Lightning talk (10 minutes).** Very quick talk to introduce people to a topic or subject or interest.

**Talk or presentation (25 or 55 minutes).** Classic talk or presentation with 20 or 50 minutes for the talk itself and 5 minutes for questions.

**Panel discussion (55 minutes).** This is intended to provide a place for a selected guest of experts to discuss and talk about important topics.

**Workshop (115 or 175 minutes).** Workshops are intended to give participants in-depth or hands-on learnings about open data or open-source software. Whether you want to run a mapathon, or introduce users how to create maps using QGIS, or teach people the aesthetics of good cartography design, we welcome workshops on varied geo-topics!

**Tapok tapok session (aka birds of a feather).** If you just want a meeting for like-minded people to talk about a specific topic or agenda, this is the session type you should choose. Tapok tapok sessions are intended to be informal, spontaneous discussions and have no set meeting agenda other than the topic.

### Language
Since we may have participants coming from outside the Philippines, the preferred language for your session is English. It is an important aspect of the conference that visitors can interact with the speaker for questions and discussion. Tapok-tapok sessions, however, can be held in another language especially if the topic is specific to a region or place.

### Publication
We want to conference to be useful even for those who are not able to attend the event in person. As such, we plan to publish video recordings and slides of the sessions online under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA 4.0).
