<h1 class="color-pnm-red">Pista ng Mapa 2020 Map & Poster Making Contest</h1>

<h2 class="color-pnm-blue">About the contest</h2>
Let’s make our year mappy! Everyone is encouraged to join the map & poster making competition of this year's Pista ng Mapa -- the premier open mapping conference in the Philippines. Through this contest, we want to showcase the resilience and creativity of our map makers in telling stories and conveying information through free and open mapping.

### Theme
This year's theme is **Mapa Para sa Lahat**.

We are encouraging everyone to submit their best cartographic work to the competition. The maps can have different subjects, forms and styles and we leave it to the map makers to choose the story they want to tell, information they want to convey, or questions they want to answer through their maps. However, each entry **must contain** the following elements:
* **Clarity of purpose** - the purpose of your map must immediately be understandable by your audience.
* **Usability** - you must be explicit in telling your audience how to navigate your map and how to interpret it.
* **Whose interest does the map serve** - what are the values and desires that you are weaving into your cartographic work.


### Categories
The competition will have 2 categories.
* **Static Maps**
    * A digital map or poster
    * Images of a physical map that was hand-made or printed
* **Interactive Maps**
    * A webpage that tells a data story through an interactive map
    * A dashboard that visualizes data spatially
    * A platform that displays spatial data

**Submissions must be an original work**

### Who may join
* The competition is open to all and everyone is free to join. There will be **TWO TRACKS** where winners will be selected: one for **Students** and another for **Professionals / Non-students**. Students include those pursuing post-graduate (MS, PhD) studies and must be currently enrolled. Participants submitting under the Student track must also provide proof of enrollment.
* Maps, cartographic research posters, and other displays of cartography-related work qualify as long as they have not yet been submitted to or they have not won a prior related competition.
* The submission must be an original work.
