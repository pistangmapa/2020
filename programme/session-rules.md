While wardrobe (or any other) video conferencing bloopers tend to become memorable, we want you (the participants) to remember PnM 2020 for our presenters' insights and messages. With this in mind, and with the goal of a smooth and enjoyable Pista, the organizing team has crafted a short supplement to our [Code of Conduct](https://pistangmapa.github.io/2020/code-of-conduct).

## General Guidelines

* Please dress appropriately. 
* Sit against a clean and non-distracting background. 
* Ensure the lighting is appropriate.
* Mute your microphone when youâ€™re not speaking.
* Ensure that your mic volume is appropriate.
* Take notes by hand (to avoid being distracted from operating the video conferencing app)
* Look at the camera (not yourself) while speaking.
* And lastly, enjoy!

## Joining the Sessions

* For your in-session name please use the following format: <firstname or nickname> <lastname -- optional> (<affiliation or current location>) e.g. Juan Tamad (Manila, Ph), Jose (Bicol University)
* We'll open the meeting room thirty minutes before the start of the sessions. We recommend you enter at this time to avoid admission delays.
  * New to Jitsi? Check out this short [tour of the user interface](https://docs.8x8.com/8x8WebHelp/virtual-office-desktop-new/Content/meeting-tour-interface.htm).
      * 8x8 registration is optional, and **not** required.
      * Optional: [download](https://download.8x8.vc/) the app for your platform, or use Firefox.

* Upon entry you will be taken to our session lobby. Only registered participants would be allowed entry to the live session proper. 
  * In the unlikely event that you are not admitted, or prefer to remain anonymous by not registering, you may watch and participate through our [Pista ng Mapa Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBK_Xl0waWLv--GpvrcTzVQ) or the [Pista ng Mapa Facebook](https://fb.com/pistangmapa2020) page.
* Again, please make sure your mic and camera are turned off upon entry. You can only turn them on when our session director instructs you to e.g. you're a presenter, or when asking questions.

## Asking a question
* You can submit questions at any time on the chat function (or another app if we find a suitable one?)
    * Our moderators would strive to queue them on a first in first out basis. (Related questions might be lumped together.) 
* By default questions would be read by our Master of Ceremony (MoC) during the alloted Q & A timeslot.
* Should the opportunity allow it, participants will be prompted by our Session director or MoC to ask your question live (unfortunately no guarantees!)
* We encourage our participants to speak, write, and ask in a language they are comfortable with. By default Filipino and English should be OK. For others Philippine languanges we'll definitely try, however we cannot guarantee translation for all languages.
* Should any questions be left unanswered (e.g. time runs out), we'll ask our presenters to answers though chat or through the comment section of our social media channels.

## Workshops
* By default the same rules apply for workshops, unless explicitly modified by the workshop facilitator.
* As the need arises workshop facilitators are allowed aply their own session guidelines consistent with our CoC. 

## Disclaimers
Not all activities and guidelines might be announced before the session, please stay tuned during the simulcast for announcements and surprises.

The PnM 2020 team reserves the right to modify and update these guidelines as the need arises.
