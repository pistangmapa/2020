presentation-description: "Let's map the Philippines' UNMAPPED 24! 
<br><br>
In a study conducted by Thinking Machines on OSM completeness in the Philippines, it was identified that 24 towns do not have a single building footprint on OpenStreetMap. A total of more than 100,000 families or roughly 500,000 individuals reside in these unmapped communities making it difficult to provide basic social services and support during disasters.
<br><br>
As part of its advocacy to represent the marginalized and under represented communities, MapBeks is mapping out buildings and roads in all 24 towns in the country through the support of several LGBTQIA+ associations, PLHIV groups, student organizations, and other emerging mapping communities.
<br><br>
The output of these mapping tasks would help the local government improve on their Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) for planning and development and better handling of disaster risk reduction and management."
