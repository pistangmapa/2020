presentation-description: "If you have been around OSM for a while, you will probably have heard of MapRoulette, the micro-tasking platform for OpenStreetMap. Using MapRoulette, anyone can solve small tasks to help improve OSM in your local area, or anywhere in the world. Creating tasks for others to solve is made easy with an intuitive web interface. Thousands of Challenges are currently online and millions of tasks have been solved by mappers like you!
<br><br>
In this talk, Martijn van Exel will show you around MapRoulette, and highlight the most interesting features that were added in the last year. He will also look ahead to some of the exciting new features coming in the near future.
<br><br>
To round out the presentation, Martijn will share a new challenge he created in collaboration with TomTom, his employer. The Challenge identifies thousands of unnamed OSM ways in The Philippines that TomTom knows the name of."
