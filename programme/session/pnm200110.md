presentation-description: "In this analysis of Marikina's evacuation centers, we will illustrate how unsuitable many of them are in terms of their medium to high exposure to flooding and incapacity to serve nearby residents. We will then try to look into the suitability of other areas, hoping to find viable locations for new evacuation centers. We found Marikina Heights as the most viable location for evacuation centers. But anything built there cannot serve other densely populated areas. 
<br><br>
What about other suitable locations that are already built up land? There is always the option of finding existing buildings other than schools and covered courts that can also serve as shelters. While Marikina can be lauded in the herculean task of effectively instituting information campaigns and building flood control infrastructures, it is also important that they look into critical infrastructures that are heavily utilized at the onset, during and soon after a typhoon or flooding. Although these are temporary relief, evacuees' experiences in these shelters will definitely set the tone for their successful return and recovery."
